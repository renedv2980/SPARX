   <Column name="Note" value="A relationship in which one party (as a fiduciary) who holds a legal or ethical relationship of trust with other party and is expected to manage the assets for the benefit of the other. 

A relationship in which one party places special trust, confidence, and reliance in and is influenced by another who has a fiduciary duty to act for the benefit of the party. (Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law)

A fiduciary is a person who holds a legal or ethical relationship of trust with one or more other parties (person or group of persons). Typically, a fiduciary prudently takes care of money or other assets for another person. (Wikipedia) 

A fiduciary duty is an acceptance of responsibility to act in the best interests of another person or entity. (Investopedia)

A fiduciary duty is a commitment to act in the best interests of another person or entity. Broadly speaking, a fiduciary duty is a duty of loyalty and a duty of care. That is, the fiduciary must act only in the best interests of a client or beneficiary. And, the fiduciary must act diligently in those interests. (Investopedia)

The fiduciary is expected to manage the assets for the benefit of the other person, rather than for their own profit, and cannot benefit personally from their management of assets. (Investopedia)

- Portfolio investments are passive investments, as they do not entail active management or control of the issuing company.
- A portfolio investment is an asset that is purchased in the expectation that it will earn a return or grow in value, or both.
- A portfolio investment is passive, unlike a direct investment, which implies hands-on management.
- Risk tolerance and time horizon are key factors in selecting any portfolio investment.

Comment: 
It is a bookkeeping instrument holding the amount or value of something by registering the movements in plus and min when events happen which have an impact on the position.
The term "account" is usually associated to an accounting or bookkeeping concept to hold the financial or stock state of a business concept. An account will typically group the debit and credit entries for a specific aspect of the business resulting from transactions,
Often accounts are represented as a T-account which is a visual aid used to depict an account. Above the top portion of the T would be the account title. On the left-side of the base of the T would be any debit amounts; on the right-side would be the credit amounts.
A commonly used bookkeeping method is the double-entry method. This means that every transaction has at least 2 movements. If a customer pays 100 € in cash, there is
a decrease in the amount that the customer owes to the company (the customer position is decreased)
an increase in the amount that the company has in cash (the cash position is increased)

An account can be assigning to one or more ledgers. A ledger is a group of accounts for a certain purpose. If there is need for multiple ledgers because of multiple purpose, an account can perfectly well assigned to multiple ledgers. When Ledgers are in real physical books, this is not possible. When ledgers are digital, accounts can be grouped into multiple groups at the same time. This practice is very rarely taught into courses for accounting, but in digital accounting, it is common practice.

Examples: 
stock account of a shop, cash register, bank account, financial accounting account, customer account, supplier account, ...
Bank Account BE12 1234 5678 9012: is an individual banking account
Accounts Payable, is a collective account keeping the balance of the amounts to pay by the organisation to its suppliers. The balance is the result of the financial movements related to suppliers. This account is managed usually in a General Ledger 
Supplier Account X, is an individual account keeping the balance of the amounts to pay by the organisation to an individual supplier. The balance is the result of the financial movements related to an individual supplier. This account is managed usually in a sub-ledger.
Stock Account x, is an individual account keeping the balance of the amounts in stock of a specific good.
A payment service to take fund out of an account. '/>
