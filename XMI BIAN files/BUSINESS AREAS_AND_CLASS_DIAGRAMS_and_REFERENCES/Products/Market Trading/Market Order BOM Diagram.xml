- Portfolio investments are passive investments, as they do not entail active management or control of the issuing company.
- A portfolio investment is an asset that is purchased in the expectation that it will earn a return or grow in value, or both.
- A portfolio investment is passive, unlike a direct investment, which implies hands-on management.

A fungible, negotiable financial instrument that holds some type of monetary value used to raise capital in public and private markets.

There are primarily three types of securities: equity - which provide ownership rights to holders, debt - which are essentially loans that are repaid with periodic payments, and hybrid - which combine aspects of debt and equity.

Fungibility is the ability of a good or asset to be interchanged with other individual goods or assets of the same type.

Comment: 
It is a bookkeeping instrument holding the amount or value of something by registering the movements in plus and min when events happen which have an impact on the position.
The term "account" is usually associated to an accounting or bookkeeping concept to hold the financial or stock state of a business concept. An account will typically group the debit and credit entries for a specific aspect of the business resulting from transactions,
Often accounts are represented as a T-account which is a visual aid used to depict an account. Above the top portion of the T would be the account title. On the left-side of the base of the T would be any debit amounts; on the right-side would be the credit amounts.
A commonly used bookkeeping method is the double-entry method. This means that every transaction has at least 2 movements. If a customer pays 100 € in cash, there is
a decrease in the amount that the customer owes to the company (the customer position is decreased)
an increase in the amount that the company has in cash (the cash position is increased)

An account can be assigning to one or more ledgers. A ledger is a group of accounts for a certain purpose. If there is need for multiple ledgers because of multiple purpose, an account can perfectly well assigned to multiple ledgers. When Ledgers are in real physical books, this is not possible. When ledgers are digital, accounts can be grouped into multiple groups at the same time. This practice is very rarely taught into courses for accounting, but in digital accounting, it is common practice.

Examples: 
stock account of a shop, cash register, bank account, financial accounting account, customer account, supplier account, ...
Bank Account BE12 1234 5678 9012: is an individual banking account
Accounts Payable, is a collective account keeping the balance of the amounts to pay by the organisation to its suppliers. The balance is the result of the financial movements related to suppliers. This account is managed usually in a General Ledger 
Supplier Account X, is an individual account keeping the balance of the amounts to pay by the organisation to an individual supplier. The balance is the result of the financial movements related to an individual supplier. This account is managed usually in a sub-ledger.
Stock Account x, is an individual account keeping the balance of the amounts in stock of a specific good.

- Portfolio investments are passive investments, as they do not entail active management or control of the issuing company.
- A portfolio investment is an asset that is purchased in the expectation that it will earn a return or grow in value, or both.
- A portfolio investment is passive, unlike a direct investment, which implies hands-on management.
- Risk tolerance and time horizon are key factors in selecting any portfolio investment.

What is a Position?
A position is the amount of a security, commodity or currency which is owned by an individual, dealer, institution, or other fiscal entity. They come in two types: short positions, which are borrowed and then sold, and long positions, which are owned and then sold. Depending on market trends, movements and fluctuations, a position can be profitable or unprofitable. Restating the value of a position to reflect its actual current value on the open market is referred to in the industry as mark-to-market. (Investopedia)

Comment: 
It is a bookkeeping instrument holding the amount or value of something by registering the movements in plus and min when events happen which have an impact on the position.
The term "account" is usually associated to an accounting or bookkeeping concept to hold the financial or stock state of a business concept. An account will typically group the debit and credit entries for a specific aspect of the business resulting from transactions,
Often accounts are represented as a T-account which is a visual aid used to depict an account. Above the top portion of the T would be the account title. On the left-side of the base of the T would be any debit amounts; on the right-side would be the credit amounts.
A commonly used bookkeeping method is the double-entry method. This means that every transaction has at least 2 movements. If a customer pays 100 € in cash, there is
a decrease in the amount that the customer owes to the company (the customer position is decreased)
an increase in the amount that the company has in cash (the cash position is increased)

An account can be assigning to one or more ledgers. A ledger is a group of accounts for a certain purpose. If there is need for multiple ledgers because of multiple purpose, an account can perfectly well assigned to multiple ledgers. When Ledgers are in real physical books, this is not possible. When ledgers are digital, accounts can be grouped into multiple groups at the same time. This practice is very rarely taught into courses for accounting, but in digital accounting, it is common practice.

Examples: 
stock account of a shop, cash register, bank account, financial accounting account, customer account, supplier account, ...

Accounts Payable, is a collective account keeping the balance of the amounts to pay by the organisation to its suppliers. The balance is the result of the financial movements related to suppliers. This account is managed usually in a General Ledger 
Supplier Account X, is an individual account keeping the balance of the amounts to pay by the organisation to an individual supplier. The balance is the result of the financial movements related to an individual supplier. This account is managed usually in a sub-ledger.

What is a Position?
A position is the amount of a security, commodity or currency which is owned by an individual, dealer, institution, or other fiscal entity. They come in two types: short positions, which are borrowed and then sold, and long positions, which are owned and then sold. Depending on market trends, movements and fluctuations, a position can be profitable or unprofitable. Restating the value of a position to reflect its actual current value on the open market is referred to in the industry as mark-to-market. (Investopedia)
